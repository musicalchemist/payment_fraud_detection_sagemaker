# Detecting Payment Card Fraud

AWS Sagemaker's LinearLearner Binary classifcation algorithm is used to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. 

The payment fraud data set (Dal Pozzolo et al. 2015) was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data). This has features and labels for thousands of credit card transactions, each of which is labeled as fraudulent or valid.
